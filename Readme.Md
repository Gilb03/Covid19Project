# 🦠Covid19 Data Analysis Project 🦠 

# About 📝
This project is about tracking and drawing insights from data on Covid-19. In summary, this is one of several ETL experiments using positive, hospitalized, death, recovered,in ICU etc. as key performance indicators of the virus impact. The start date of the tracking is January 22nd, 2020. 

# The How 🤔
The covid module pulls JSON data and transforms it into a python dictionary. The dictionary is then handed down to acouople functions that pull new information in and add the new information as a row to the end of the logs file. Currently there are 221 records, showing an increase in field fulfillment as more and more cases and states are reporting their data. I contribute to this repository of data which is updated daily between 5p and 7:30 CST. 


# The Source 🔌
The source of this information is from each states local/territorial public health authorities, official press conferences with the governor and public health authorities.
