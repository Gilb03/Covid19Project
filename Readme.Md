# Purpose
To learn more about tools and cretive ways to capture data and use it to better understand our surroundings. This project tracks all of the current numbers in the United States. I want to trrack the current numbers as well as see if we can derive any insight between the two datasets. All information from this project is for academic research only. 

# About
This project is about tracking and drawing insights from Covid-19 data. Categories include positive, hospitalized, death, recovered, in ICU, and about 16 other KPI's. The start date of the tracking is January 22nd, 2020. Ideally, we'd like to use this to predict future pandemics, or disparities according to certain factors during pandemic response. 

Currently, there are 321 records, showing an increase in field fulfillment as more and more cases and states are reporting their data. This repository is updated Sundays between 5p and 7:30 CST weekly.
