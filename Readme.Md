# About
Tracking and drawing insights from API data on Covid19. A Summation of ETL experiments using requests, csv, json, and pandas for heavier key performance indicators such as hospitalized, death, recovered, increase in diagnosage,in ICUetc. The start date of the tracking is January 22nd, 2020. The Covid module pulls JSON data and transforms it into a Python dictionary. The Dictionary is then handed down to acouople functions that pullnew information in and add the new information as rows to the end of the logs.csv file. Currently there are 221 records, showing an increase in field fulfillment as more and more cases and states are reporting their data. I contribute to this man made compilation of data which is updated daily between 5p and 7:30 CST. The source of this information is from each states local/territorial public health authorities, official press conferences with the governor and public health authorities.
