# Purpose
To learn more about tools and creative ways to capture data and use it to better understand our surroundings. This project keeps record of the current numbers in the United States. I want to track the current numbers and see what patterns we can find from the data. All information from this project is for academic research only. 

# About
This project is about tracking and drawing insights from Covid-19 data. Categories include positive, hospitalized, death, recovered, in ICU, and about 16 other columns worth noting. The start date of the tracking is January 22nd, 2020. Ideally, I'd like to use this to see if we could predict future pandemics, or disparities according to certain factors during pandemic response. This includes who is more likely to receive funding during disasters. 

Currently, there are about 322 records, showing an increase in field fulfillment as more and more cases and states are reporting their data. This repository is updated Sundays between 5p and 7:30 CST weekly. As we come to the close of the year there will be a short report shared to understand updates and hopefully inspire people to move the safest way possible for their households.
