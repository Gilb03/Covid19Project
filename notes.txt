Track COVID-19 data virtually
    A. Track Current Nation Data (class or arbitrary function?)
        Fields: date, date checked, positive, death, hospitalizedCumulative, recovered
        
    
    B. Track Current State Data (class)
        Fields: dateModified, deathConfirmed, positive, state date 


Process: 
1. install dependencies ( request, flask, urllib, venv, psycopg2, anything else?) ✅

2. parse the returned python list so that the console displays current status of 
the nation and its fields listed in A un-jsonified. ✅
    - write a format function to handle this : store url in variable, function formats vriable and prints in form format ✅

3. Create a class, functions to handle transformation 

4. create and connect to postgresql database 
    (make db and create target fields for app to fill)

*5. create a second file (ingest.py) which will transform and send the data to postgresdb
    - this must include psycopg driver, create table , 
    fill table ,cursors and commit and closing the connection*


5. test and then prep for airflow and automation.
